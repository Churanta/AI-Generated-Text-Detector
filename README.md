# AI-Generated-Text-Detector

This Python script detects the probability of text being generated by an AI model. The script uses the Hugging Face Transformers library to load a pre-trained language model and generates new text from the input text. If the generated text is similar to the input text, the probability of the input text being generated by an AI model is high.

## Getting Started
To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

- `'nltk '`
-  `'transformers '`

You can install these packages by running the following command:
'pip install nltk transformers'

## Usage
 - `'** python ** app.py '`

When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter the text you want to analyze. After you enter the text, the script will analyze it and output the probability of the text being generated by an AI model.

## Example
Here's an example usage of the script:
python app.py
Enter the text you want to analyze: This is a test sentence.
The input text has a 2.5% probability of being generated by an AI model.
